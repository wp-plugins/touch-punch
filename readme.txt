Lightweight Plugin to fully control the WordPress admin on an iPad device using touch screen gestures!

== Description ==

By default you can't drag/drop items in the WordPress admin on an iPad, which is a bit limiting. This Plugin fixes that by adding the Touch Punch jQuery library to map iPad touch events to mouse events.

Once activated the Plugin allows you to do things like drag/drop widgets into widget areas, change navigation menus etc. simply by using touch gestures on the iPad!

Full list of iPad activated WordPress admin pages:

* Admin dashboard - Drag to re-order admin dashboard widgets.
* Widgets page - Drag new widget instances into widget areas, and sort existing widgets.
* New posts/pages - Drag to re-order meta boxes on new post/pages.
* Edit posts/pages - Drag to re-order meta boxes on existing post/pages.
* Navigation menu page - Drag to re-order meta boxes, and individual menu items to change position/hierarchy.
* Add new links page - Drag to re-order meta boxes (Note: the first three meta boxes are fixed by WordPress but the others are sortable).

Plugin options allow you to turn the touch punch library on/off, and optionally enable it on the front end of your site. You might want to do this if you have sortable items that you wish to be re-ordered using iPad touch gestures!

Please rate this Plugin if you find it useful, thanks.
